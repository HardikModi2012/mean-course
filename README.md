#1 to install packages , need to run npm install in root path

----------------------Node JS

for Node JS 

we need to run following commands
# npm run start: server

than we have added package nodemon while saving

# nodemon

# npm install --save-dev nodemon 
(development side only)

whenever any changes on server side, this will check files and if there is any changes than automatically restart the server

body-parser is used as middle-ware 
data is coming as string so this package will parse that to data Object
# npm install --save body-parser

added mongoose package for db connection to mongo db

# npm install --save mongoose

and also added extension of MongoDb in VS code

Search extension with Mongodb for VS CODE
